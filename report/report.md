### Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree## Capstone Project# Machine Translation from Swedish to English with KerasNicholas Cottrell, nic@cottrell.netFebruary, 2019## I. Definition<!--_(approx. 1-2 pages)_-->### Project Overview<!--In this section, look to provide a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?_- _Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?_-->In recent years, machine translation (MT) with neural networks has proven that it can deliver superior results compared to older rule-based or statistical MT. Google and Facebook have been able to quickly put services into production based on neural machine translation (NMT) given their access to huge data sources and including private hand-coded parallel corpora for the target languages. There are a number of attempts to create similar systems based on open source NN modeling tools such as Keras and Tensorflow (open-sourced from Google’s research) and PyTorch (an alternative approach to tensor modeling open-sourced by Facebook’s research teams). These attempts use open-source parallel corpora for training input and examples online give a hint at what can be achieved, while most make large simplifications and don’t handle many edge cases. For example, one example for English to German starts by lowercasing all training data and removing all punctuation. Word case in German is extremely important and punctuation can affect the translation choice. There is a difference between “Hello!” and “Hello?”. There are a number of related NLP fields using neural networks which flow into the translation problem. For example, there are solutions which can train unsupervised on German input text to discover word components. For example, the German word _Fingerspitzengefühl_ (Literally: the fingertip feeling)  made up of _Finger + Spitzen + Gefühl_ (finger + tip + feeling). Since all the MT modules take one-hot encoded inputs, the size of the vocabulary is a limiting factor in defining and training models. Some approaches simply limit the vocabulary size, ignoring uncommon words completely. Due to the agglutinative native of Germanic languages, there are many more “word” permutations that in English. Some research has explored handling input as single characters, or breaking down input words into 2 or 3-letter long chunks. For example, Fingerspitzengefühl would be split into _Fin + ger + spi + tze + nge + füh + l_. This approach can successfully limit the vocabulary size (maximum would be C^n where C is the number of different characters (say 35 including accents etc.) and n is the chunk size (3 in this example). This gives almost 300.000 vocabulary which is still very large. The other downside is that number of these 3-letter components themselves have any semantic value.  A better system would be to combine intelligent component detection as part of a cleaning/preparation step before training the translation model. Thus, an input sentence “Er hat das Fingerspitzengefühl” (Translation: “He has an instinct for tactfulness”) would be broken into components _“Er” + “hat” + “das” + “Finger” + “Spitzen” + “Gefühl”_. Note that we are capitalizing the component words since they themselves are nouns which are naturally capitalized in German. This helps us reduce the vocabulary size and lets the model fall back to a word-by-word translation if it doesn’t have enough data. Whether this can be achieved fully automatically has yet to be shown.### Problem Statement<!--In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?_- _Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?_- _Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?_-->For this project, the problem to be solved is how to quickly, cheaply and accurately translate written text in a foreign language into something the user can understand (preferably their first language). The scope of translation could include spoken word, or even using optical character recognition via augmented reality framework on mobile devices to recognize text from street signs, menus and other materials. For the purposes of this project, I intend to focus on text already in digital format and deal with the already numerous challenges of processing and transforming that into a translated version which accurately conveys the meaning and non-textual content (numbers, dates, etc.) that can also handle real world input such as spelling mistakes, and unseen inputs (such as named entities - names of people, places, organizations etc.). There is already much research on major language pairs such as English to French, Spanish or Chinese. Although the more dissimilar the language the harder it is to achieve a natural and accurate result. Current neural translation models have proved to provide much better translation models for dissimulate language without any significant pre- or post-processing when compared to other rule-based or statistical methods. However, for this project I want to focus on a less-common language pair: English↔Swedish both of which I speak natively.  ### Metrics<!--In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?_- _Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?_-->Machine Translation systems have been in development since the 1940s and there is a wide body of parallel corpora available - many in the form of sentence pairs that have been either created by hand or at least reviewed by a human. These sentence pairs provide a single “correct translation” for the source language text. However, obviously, there is more than one way to translate any given sentence and so some data sources include multiple candidate translations for any given input. In either case, there is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of a machine translation called BLEU which uses n-grams (usually 1 to 3 words) and compares the output from the model against the candidates and then scores based on the following steps:1. Collect N-gram overlap between machine translation output and reference translation 1. Compute precision for n-grams of size 1 to 4![BLEU function](bleu-algo.png)1. Add brevity penalty (for too short translations)This algorithm is computationally efficient, gives very similar results to human ‘evaluators’ assuming the candidate translations are accurate and is very widely used in the MT field. Luckily [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) provides a ready-made implementation in its [bleu_score.py](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/translate/bleu_score.html)## II. Analysis<!--_(approx. 2-4 pages)_-->### Data Exploration<!--In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_-->The data in the `swe.txt` file simply contains pairs of sentences in Utf-8 ordered by shortest first like:```Run!	Spring!Who?	Vem?Help!	Hjälp!``` up to the longest like:```If you take a child outside and point at the moon, they will look at the moon. If you do the same thing with a dog, it will look at your finger.	Om du tar med ett barn ut och pekar på månen, så tittar barnet på månen. Gör du samma sak med en hund så tittar den på ditt finger.The Tatoeba Project, which can be found online at tatoeba.org, is working on creating a large database of example sentences translated into many languages.	Tatoebaprojektet, som återfinns online på tatoeba.org, går ut på att skapa en stor databas med exempelmeningar översatta till många språk.```The longest sentences are about 160 characters long, with the longest being 24 words in English, and only 20 words in Swedish due to the agglunative nature of that language. The dataset contains 17,300 language pairs which is sufficient for this experiment in comparing tokenization schemes, but real-world machine translation systems are often trained one _millions_ of sentence pairs.#### Dataset TokenizationAfter a lot of experimentation and coding, I created six different tokenizer classes in the tokenizers.py file:|	| Tokenizer class	|Description||----|----|---||a|	`SimpleLines`	|Tokenize on spaces and punctuation, and keep punctuation but not spaces|b	|Hyphenate	|Use a [hypenate library](https://bitbucket.org/fhaxbox66/pyhyphen) to use `SimpleLines` first then break down longer words into sub-parts to reduce the dimensionality||c |	`Word2Phrase`	|Tokenize as above, but combine popular phrases into a single token, e.g. "good-bye" and "Eiffel Tower" will be single tokens.|d	|`ReplaceProper`	|Tokenize, but replace proper nouns with a placeholder so we don't pollute the model with possibly unlimited [named entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) .||e 	|`PosTag`	|Tokenize as above, but run a [part-of-speech tagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)  on each sentence. This will result in token like "duck.VF" and "duck.NN" for verbs and nouns.||l 	|`LetterByLetter`	|Tokenize the sentence into individual words, preserving all spaces and punctuation. This gives a very small input space but should be possible for an attention-based model.|### Exploratory Visualization<!--In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_-->The data from the following table is created by the `print_vocab_summary()` function in the `tokenizers_summary.py` file:| Code	| Tokenizer |	English Vocab	| English Max Length	| Swedish Vocab	| Swedish Max Length||----|----|----|-----|---|----||a	|`SimpleWords`	|5053	|36	|7193	|32||b 	|`Hyphenate`	|4044	|73	|3421	|71||c 	|`Word2Phrase`	|5506	|33	|7637	|31||d 	|`ReplaceProper`	|4836	|36	|4863|	32||e 	|`PosTag`	|5542	|36	|8349	|32||l 	|`LetterByLetter`	|74	|159	|78	|142|This indicates that our training corpus has only about 5000 different English words (based on `SimpleWords` above), whereas an article from the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/johnson/2013/05/29/lexical-facts) indicates that an adult speakers has a normal vocabulary range of about 20-35,000 words. So our sample includes less than 25% of common words, but should still be sufficient for this experiment since it gives a reasonable sample for performing different tokenization schemes.You can see from the table above that our dataset actually contains very few proper nouns and ambiguous parts of speech. The vocabularly size for `ReplaceProper` is only about 4% reduced compared to the original `SimpleWords`. And the `PosTag` vocabularly is only about 10% increased by adding part of speech information to each input token.  ### Algorithms and Techniques<!--In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_-->For this research, I wanted to explore deep learning techniques with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). I ended up choosing [Keras](https://keras.io) for defining and training the different models since this framework provides a good level of abstraction from TensorFlow and would allow the testing of different Machine Learning backends (like [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)) in the future.#### ModelsI started with a very simple Recurrent Neural Network model defined in `simple.py` based on work by [ChunML](https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/project/Sequence-To-Sequence/). This model expected fixed-width input, and had the following layers:1. An `Embedding` layer to represent word embeddings1. A [Long short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) (LSTM) Layer which can process data sequentially and keep its hidden state through time. This first LSTM 'decodes' the input sentence tokens from the source language (Swedish)1. A `RepeatVector` layer which TODO  1. Another LSTM layer to TODO1. Ending with a TimeDistributed and Dense layer, wuth softmax acivation to TODOThis model can be visualized as:![Simple model](simple_model.png) However, this model gives very poor results because it lacks a way to consider context in the translation process. A more advanced approach uses separate encoder and decoder models.The algorithm is roughly as follows:- We start with input sequences from a domain (e.g. English sentences)    and corresponding target sequences from another domain    (e.g. French sentences).- An encoder LSTM turns input sequences to 2 state vectors    (we keep the last LSTM state and discard the outputs).- A decoder LSTM is trained to turn the target sequences into    the same sequence but offset by one timestep in the future,    a training process called "teacher forcing" in this context.    It uses as initial state the state vectors from the encoder.    Effectively, the decoder learns to generate `targets[t+1...]`    given `targets[...t]`, conditioned on the input sequence.- In inference mode, when we want to decode unknown input sequences, we:    - Encode the input sequence into state vectors    - Start with a target sequence of size 1        (just the start-of-sequence character)    - Feed the state vectors and 1-char target sequence        to the decoder to produce predictions for the next character    - Sample the next character using these predictions        (we simply use argmax).    - Append the sampled character to the target sequence    - Repeat until we generate the end-of-sequence character or we        hit the character limit.        This model can be visualized as:![Attention model with dropout](attdropout_model.png) #### TokenizersIn addition to testing different model designs and tokenization options, I wanted to see which [optimizers](https://keras.io/optimizers/) worked best for each combinations, so tested each model/tokenization with the following optimizers:|Code|Name|Comment||----|-----|-----||`adam`|[Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8)|A gradient-based stochastic optimizer. This optimizer is known to be computationally-efficient and to require little tuning, so should be a good initial choice.|`sgd`|Stochastic gradient descent|Default parameters of a learning rate of `0.01` and no decay. This option is expected to be more 'stable' than `adam`||`sgd2`|Stochastic gradient descent with decay|Defined as `optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)` slowly decreasing the learning rate as the training progressed||`rmsprop`|RMSProp|Used the default learning rate of `0.001` and no decay. This optimizer uses an adaptive learning rate and is known as a good choice for recurrent neural networks like our models||`rmsprop2`|RMSProp with higher LR|Defined as `optimizers.RMSprop(lr=0.01)`. Given 10x higher initial learning rate so see if the training could quickly reach good results in the first few epochs.||`rmsprop3`|RMSProp wih high LR and decay|Defined as `optimizers.RMSprop(lr=0.01, decay=0.00001)`,  # same as previous but with decay   ### BenchmarkIn this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_## III. Methodology_(approx. 3-5 pages)_### Data PreprocessingIn this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_### ImplementationIn this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_### RefinementIn this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_## IV. Results_(approx. 2-3 pages)_### Model Evaluation and ValidationIn this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_### JustificationIn this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_## V. Conclusion_(approx. 1-2 pages)_### Free-Form VisualizationIn this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_### ReflectionIn this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_### ImprovementIn this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_-----------**Before submitting, ask yourself. . .**- Does the project report you’ve written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?- Is each section (particularly **Analysis** and **Methodology**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion?
